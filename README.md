## General Info

Designed and coded by Kimberlea Heili

Prototype made in Adobe XD: https://xd.adobe.com/view/847a9579-2d3a-40c7-8f2e-7240a4c920a9-d129/

The purpose of this website is to practice web design and more challenging code, and to ultimately be a polished piece in my portfolio. This website will only be a demo and the nav bar and many elements of the website will intentionally be nonfunctional.
